This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
food <- read.csv('Food_production.csv')
```

```{r}
head(food)
```


```{r}
summary(food)
```
```{r}
food_subset <- food[, c("Food.product", "Land.use.change", "Total_emissions")]
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
food_production_summary <- food_subset %>% 
  group_by(Food.product) %>% 
  summarize(Total_emissions = sum(Total_emissions, na.rm = TRUE),
            Mean_Land_Use = mean(Land.use.change, na.rm = TRUE))
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)

food %>%
  summarize(mean_land_use = mean(Land.use.change, na.rm = TRUE))
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(food_production_summary, aes(x = Food.product, y = Total_emissions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "dodgerblue3") +
  xlab("Food Product") +
  ylab("Total Emissions") +
  ggtitle("Total Emissions by Food Product") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
